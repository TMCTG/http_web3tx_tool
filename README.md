This is a single html file that can build a transaction for any EVM chain, then sign and send it with your MetaMask/Rabby browser add-in.

You need to serve it with a lightweight web server for it to work properly. XAMPP is fine, but Mongoose is super simple:

1. Download the Mongoose binary for your system at https://mongoose.ws/binary/
2. Put the index.html file and the mongoose binary in the same folder.
3. Run mongoose with minimum rights.
4. Open the webpage in your browser by going to http://localhost:8000/
